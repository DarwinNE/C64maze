# C64maze
A 3D maze game written in C for the Commodore 64.

This project (distributed with the GPLv.3 license) is a very simple 3D maze for
the Commodore 64 computer. The source code is written in C (with some inline
assembly) and it is meant to be compiled with the cc65 compiler.

Nothing very particular for the moment, still very much work in progress.
